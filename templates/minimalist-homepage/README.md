# Homepage Template with ✨Rad✨ Menue

Here is a template for a minimalist homepage for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) along with two custom CSS Snippets for callout styling. 

I apologize in advance for the the messy snippets. I am *very* new to the world of CSS and learning as I go (this is also my first upload to github congrats to me). Sharing this is one way for me to push myself to learn it properly. I am open to feedback! ✨

## Features

- **Minimalist Homepage Template:** A minimalist template for your vault!
- **Custom Callout Styles:** Two CSS files (`dropdown-menue-callout.css` and `dotted-top-bottom-callout.css`) to style callouts.
- **Plugin Requirements:** This template is designed to work seamlessly with the following plugins:
  - [Obsidian Columns](https://github.com/tnichols217/obsidian-columns) by *tnichols217*
  - [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) by *blacksmithgu*

## Usage

1. **Download the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository using `git clone` or download it as a ZIP file.

2. **Obsidian Plugins:**
   - Install the required plugins:
     - [Obsidian Columns](https://github.com/tnichols217/obsidian-columns)
     - [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)

3. **Minimal Theme:**
   - (Optional) For an enhanced visual experience, consider using the [Minimal Theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) by *kepano*. 
    - Screenshots in this repository use this theme, and I have not tested the callouts with other themes. I have also used other snippets to change the look of the Minimal theme, so if your homepage does not look exactly like the screenshots, that might be why. I eventually plan on making a vault template once I have time.

4. **Custom CSS:**
   - Copy the contents of `dropdown-menue-callout.css` and `top-bottom-dotted-border-callout.css` into your Obsidian vault's snippets folder (Obsidian settings > Apparance > click on the small folder next to the CSS snippets heading OR /YOUR VAULT/.obsidian/snippets)

5. **Apply the Homepage Template:**
   - Open Obsidian and create a new note named `Home` (or whatever you wanna call it).
   - Copy the contents of `homepage-template.md` into the `Home` note.
